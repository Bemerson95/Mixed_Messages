## General Information
- It displays a random joke every time it's run. I  made three arrays, one for adjectives, the other one for nouns, and the last one for verbs, and then I created a function that takes in 3 arrays, then I made three variables that take a specific array and then returned a random index number from that array. Lastly, the function returns a pre-made message that displays one random adjective, noun and verb to create a random joke every time.
